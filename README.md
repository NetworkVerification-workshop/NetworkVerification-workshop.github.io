##Scope and Objective

The 1st Network Verification workshop hosted by Huawei-TU Berlin innovation lab aims to provide a forum for the community to come together and rethink fundamental questions, breakthrough solutions in Network Verification. The networks were not designed with verification as indispensable requirement. However, as more and more applications rely on correct and secure network services provided by the underlying Cloud provider, the importance of network verification on Cloud provider becomes significant. In the near future, the verification of networks and distributed systems is poised to become a mandatory first-class design goal, just like performance, reliability, etc. In the past, one impediment in designing verified networks was that the Internet was very hard to change. Networking devices used to be proprietary and expensive blackboxes provided by few switch vendors. Despite many radical proposals, many of these useful ideas and designs cannot be easily integrated into the operational network without an expensive forklift upgrade.

Lately, researchers have realized that network verification is of paramount importance. Furthermore, with the advent of network programmability, lot of flexibility and customization can be leveraged to deliver in-house and homegrown solutions. Our networking community has already developed a range of new systems and in-network capabilities such as In-band Network Telemetry (INT), In-network caching, etc. In this workshop, we are soliciting talks from the pioneers in this field that focus on developing and examining the area of network verification while identifying missing or unaddressed gaps. We welcome contributions on early ideas in these areas, talks that outline upcoming cool solutions to hot problems, as well as preliminary ideas from ongoing projects that could benefit the audience as well as the presenter via brainstorming. The workshop seeks to bring together experts from academia and industry in networking, and systems, with the goal of identifying exciting opportunities for network verification in the area of cloud datacenter networks and follow-up on interesting collaboration opportunities. We strive to strengthen the community by working towards the common goal of solving the main challenges. 

**Topics of Interest**

We invite talks on a wide range of topics of interest, including, but not limited to:

•	The network verification problems and solutions in cloud datacenter

•	Formal methods or runtime verification solutions in network verification

•	The network security aspects in cloud datacenter

•	Architectural support for network verification

•	Incrementally deployable designs for network verification

•	Network and distributed systems access control

•	Verification and Security for emerging network scenarios (e.g., Home, IoT)
